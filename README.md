# CyberScent: Capstone Backend Server

This is the server that coinsides with my frontend application, a fake online candle store. Here it establishes all mongoose routes and models to allow for full CRUD application.

You should be able to run this by using "npm nodemon server.js" -- and this should be run first before starting the website
